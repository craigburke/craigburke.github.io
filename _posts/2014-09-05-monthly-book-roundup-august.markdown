This month was a JavaScript focused one that includes two absolutely outstanding books.

    <h4><a href="http://www.manning.com/resig/">Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja</a></h4>
    <p>
        <strong>This is an amazingly good book. 
        It explained some of the more complex aspects of JavaScript (like scope, closures, and function invocation) in such a clear way. It 
        definitely provided me with plenty of insight about the language and some powerful tools and strategies to use.
        </strong>
    </p>
    
    <p> 
        A common refrain for the book was also "this would be really straightforward, but IE..." and it really gave me a window into 
        how difficult a task developing jQuery was for John Resig (one of the authors). It was really interesting seeing how jQuery
        and other libraries dealt with some of the browser JavaScript inconsistencies.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are some pretty advanced examples within this book but they tend to be broken down and explained really well. 
        I don't know if it'll qualify you to be a JavaScript ninja, but it certainly will give you plenty of idea and tools to use in your development.

    	<h4><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033486.do">AngularJS Up & Running</a></h4>
        <p><strong>
            This is hands down the best AngularJS book I've read and one I'd definitely recommend for 
            people new to AngularJS or those with more experience. 
        </strong></p>
    
        <p>
            It references a really recent version of AngularJS (1.2.19) and talked about some features I really wasn't aware of. 
            The style of the code is also consistent with Todd Motto's <a href="http://toddmotto.com/opinionated-angular-js-styleguide-for-teams/">
            Opinionated AngularJS styleguide for teams
            </a>, so this is a book that really reflects a lot of current AngularJS best practices.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This book is written by the same authors of the original O'Reilly AngularJS book, but this book fills in a lot of gaps 
            left in that book. I thought it was a nice touch to have a separate chapter on testing for controllers, services and directives
            right after they are introduced. That makes more sense to me than just having a huge chapter on testing stuck at the end of the book.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>I highly recommend this book to anyone doing (or interested in doing) AngularJS development.</strong></p>
