    <h4><a href="https://pragprog.com/book/vslg2/programming-groovy-2">Programming Groovy 2</a></h4>
  <p>I absolutely loved this book. Venkat is an excellent writer and the examples he gave were fantastic.</p> 

  <p>One of the best parts of this book is the emphasis on pitfalls for those coming from a more traditional Java background. There are some subtleties of language I learned here that I was previously unaware of.</p>

  <p>
	  <strong>This book goes pretty deep and the meta programming sections were especially good and thorough. This book is highly recommended for people looking to get a better overall understanding of the Groovy language.</strong>

    	<h4><a href="http://www.apress.com/9781430265320">Introducing Spring Framework: A Primer</a></h4>
       
		<p>This was a pretty nice (albeit basic) overview of the Spring Framework. In addition to talking about the core framework, this book also discussed a few of the offered extensions (Spring Social, Spring Data, Spring AMQP) which was actually pretty interesting.</p>

		<p>I would have liked to have seen a little more detail (especially in the parts about Groovy and Spring Boot), but it was all well written.</p>

		<p><strong>This book is geared more toward Spring beginners, but it served as a nice refresher for me while aquainting me more with some of newer features if the framework.</strong></p>
