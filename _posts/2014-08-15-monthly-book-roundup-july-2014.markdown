    <h4><a href="http://www.manning.com/koenig/">Groovy in Action</a></h4>
    <p><strong>Although a bit dated at this point (published in 2007), this is still one of the best programming 
	books I've ever read. 
    </strong></p>

    <p>I really wish I had read this book when I first started using Groovy. 
	The writing is outstanding and the examples couldn't be clearer. 
	I especially like how all the code examples include assert statements which makes them
	very easy to read and understand. I definitely have an even greater appreciation for how thoughful 
	and elegant the Groovy language is.
    </p>

    <p>
	This book contains great explanations of closures, metaprogramming, implementing builders, etc. I would
	love to see a newer addition of this book but I found it incredibly helpful anyway.
    </p>

    <p><strong>I can see now why this book gets consistently high praise from Groovy developers.</strong></p>

	<p><strong>While the code examples were excellent some of the writing was absolutely awful.</strong></p>

	<p>
	It's a shame because this had the potential to be a really excellent book. 
	There was a strong focus on testing and both the tests and the code itself were impeccable. 
	A particularly aggressive editor could have really helped here especially in the first chapter
	which was especially bad.
	</p>

	<p>There are some great tips and insights for directive development here despite the writing.<strong>
	I would recommend this book only if you're already pretty comfortable with directives otherwise you'll
	likely just end up frustrated and confused.</strong>
