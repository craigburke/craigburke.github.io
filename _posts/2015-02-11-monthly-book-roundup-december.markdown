I'm more than a little late writing my last roundup for 2014 but it includes an awesome Spring Boot book and an extremely comprehensive book about iText.

    <h4><a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-spring-boot">Learning Spring Boot</a></h4>
  	<p>
		As I'm developing more and more in Spring Boot, this book has been absolutely indespensible to me. It's very well written and examples 
		are very practical and well explained. I especially liked how code is introduced with detailed explanation of the important lines. 
	</p>
		
	<p>
		While most of the book is written using Java, Groovy gets some love in the first chapter and it made for a very pleasant introduction.
		I really enjoyed this book and I've referred back to it often since finishing it.
	</p>
	
	<p><strong>This book does an outstanding job of demystifying Spring Boot and all the magic that goes along with it. I very highly recommend it.</strong></p>

    	<h4><a href="http://itextpdf.com/book/">iText In Action</a></h4>
       
	   	<p>
			This book is incredibly comprehensive, filled with tons of examples. After reading it, I was surprised at exactly how low level the pdf format is and 
			how much the iText library does to create a really nice abstraction over that. The later chapters really dig into the more advanced aspects of creating
			pdfs.
		</p>
	   
		<p>
			I started reading this book after I began working on my <a href="https://github.com/craigburke/document-builder">Groovy Document Builder</a> and the lessons learned
			from it have been really invaluable. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>While I'm transitioning away from iText for that particular project, I think this book is definitely worth a look if you're working with iText or 
				simply want more insight about the pdf format.</strong>
