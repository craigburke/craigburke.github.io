    <h4><a href="https://leanpub.com/groovy-goodness-notebook">Groovy Goodness Notebook</a></h4>
   <p>Since this book was simply a collection of Groovy related blog posts from mrhaki, I was initially concerned about how well this book would flow. My fear turned out to be completely unfounded though since this book was extremely well organized and a joy to read.</p>

   <p>This book is pretty hefty and full of some very useful tips along with some examples that might be a bit less practical but are nonetheless explained very clearly and absolutely push your understanding of the Groovy language.</p>

   <p><strong>Mrhaki is a very clever guy and it’s facinating to see his solutions to both common and uncommon problems using the Groovy language.</strong></p>

	   <p>This book was much shorter than the Groovy book above, but I had the same “huh, I never thought of doing something like that” reaction to many of these tips.</p>

	   <p>Some of the tips relate specifically to older versions of Grails but there’s still plenty of good stuff here.</p>

	   <p>This book, like the Groovy goodness book above, is very written and extremely easy to read with very clear examples. <strong>I very highly recommend getting this as part of the Goodness bundle so you can read both of these excellent books.</strong></p>
