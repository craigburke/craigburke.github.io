    <h4><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627">Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests</a></h4>
    <p>
	This is an incredibly useful book for understanding TDD. It has a lot of good and practical advise for Object Oriented programming in general,
	but perhaps one of the best parts of this book is the project example they walk through. You really get some insight into the thought process
	and how a solution evolves as well as the tests that drive that implementation. Definitely a must read.

    <h4><a href="http://www.ng-book.com">ng-book: The Complete Book on AngularJS</a></h4>
    <p>
	This book is absolutely fantastic. It's extremely thorough and detailed, and leaves almost no aspect of the framework unexplained.
	I also appreciate that it's a bit more pragmatic than other AngularJS books (suggesting the use of Restangular instead of resources for example). This books is what you would want the actual docs to be more like: complete, clear and practical.
	This is a massive 600+ page book but there's not a lot of filler here. Cannot recommend this book more.
